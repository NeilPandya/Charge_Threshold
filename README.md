# Charge Threshold
This is a simple python script to change your laptop battery's maximum charging threshold. Lowering the max threshold to as low as 60% can increase the battery's lifespan if the laptop is plugged during most of its usage.

There may be flashier ways to do this, but this script will do the trick in a very lightweight manner.

## Usage

`sudo python3 chargeThreshold.py`
